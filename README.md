## Development Setup

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Create a network called `chatnet` to enable communication between containers. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine, and then execute the following command in the terminal:

```sh
root:~$ docker network create chatnet
```

-   Build and launch the spawner containers:

```sh
root:~$ cd apps/spawner
root:freeflow/apps/spawner$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
# Remove the -d if you want to see the logs.
```

-   After the spawner containers are up, navigate to the main folder and then the dev folder. Create the `appdata` folder and subfolders:

```sh
root:freeflow/apps/spawner$ cd ... &&  cd docker/dev
root:freeflow/docker/dev$ mkdir appdata && mkdir appdata/chats && mkdir appdata/user
# Copy the avatar image to the user folder
cp ../avatar.jpg ./appdata/user/avatar-default.jpg
```

-   Add or edit instances for the chat application in the `docker-compose-example.yml` file. Look for an example commented with `$3bot`, and replace `$3bot` with your desired 3bot name.

```yml
# docker-compose-example.yml
services:
    your-3bot-name-digitaltwin:
        container_name: your-3bot-name-chat
        # ... the rest of the docker-compose file should be updated with your 3bot name
```

Make sure every user has their own appdata folder, and ensure the container name ends with `-chat` (e.g., `your-3bot-name-chat`).
If you don't want the staging login flow, remove the `ENVIRONMENT=development` line or change it to production.
Build and launch the chat containers:

```sh
root:freeflow/docker/dev$ docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d
# Remove the -d if you want to see the logs.
```

Finally, modify your hosts file since this project is `domain-based`. Add two rules to the hosts file, changing `$3bot` to the configured `3bot` name in the `docker-compose` file. Duplicate the rules for every chat container.

### Linux

```sh
root:freeflow/docker/dev$ sudo vim /etc/hosts
```

```vim
127.0.0.1 digitaltwin.jimbertesting.be
127.0.0.1 your-3bot-name.digitaltwin.jimbertesting.be
127.0.0.1 digitaltwin-test.jimbertesting.be,
```

### Windows and macOS

Refer to How to Edit Hosts File in Windows and macOS for instructions on editing the hosts file.
